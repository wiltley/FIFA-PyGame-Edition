A game I am currently developing in my free time using primarily the pygame python module.

I am trying to create a fully fledged top down soccer game using pygame, emulating the oldschool FIFA games.

Currently planned features:

  - Good decision making CPU controlled teammates and opposition; ex: the strikers ability to perform fast breaks,
    other strategic role specific play on defence and offense.
  - Minimap to show characters not currently on screen.
  - "Smart" auto-passing feature. Ability to perform advanced passes accurately such as through-balls.
  - Free kicks, penalties, offsides etc..
  - more TBD
